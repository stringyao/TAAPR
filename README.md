# TAAPR

This repo is used to save my reading notes of the book ***Technical Analysis for Algorithmic Pattern Recognition*** by Prodromos E. Tsinaslanidis and Achilleas D. Zapranis. 

As planned, all algorithms involved in the book will be re-written in Python3 and comparions will be made with TA-lib or Quantlib when necessary.
