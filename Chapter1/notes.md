# Chapter 1 Technical Analysis 

## 1.1 introduction 

the reverse "file drawer" bias: “a researcher who genuinely believes he or she has identified a method for predicting the market has little incentive to publish the method in an academic journal and would presumably be tempted to sell it to an investment bank”

## 1.2 What Is Technical Analysis?

The cornerstone, on which the whole philosophy of TA is based, is the belief that ***human beings act similarly under similar conditions.***

## 1.3 Efficient Market Hypothesis

Random walk hypothesis and martingale models are closely related with the EMH.

A martingale is thus a sequence of random variables {P(t)} for which at a specific time t in the realised sequence, the next value’s expectation E[P(t+1)] equals with the current observed value, conditioned on all preceding observed values. (***note that the martingale model does not consider risk-premiums embedded in price returns***)

Three random walk models:

(1) RW1: increments are iid with zero mean and constant std
(2) RW2: increments are INID (independent but not identically distributed) with zero mean and heteroskedasticity
(3) RW3: increments are dependent but uncorrelated 

## 1.4 Celebrated Tools of Technical Analysis

### technical indicators

“No single indicator can ever be expected to signal all trend reversals, so it is essential to use a number of them together to build up a consensus”

### patterns

"specific forms of evolutions of price paths which are mainly identified visually"

a high level of subjectivity

various cognitive biases

### candlesticks

A candlestick pattern is identified when an individual or a sequence of candlesticks with specific characteristics is observed.

### filter rules

excess returns vanished after considering transaction costs resulted by the high frequency trading

price/time filters
